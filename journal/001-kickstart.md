# From Vim to NeoVim

I am a pretty happy Vim user, I have used it as my main editor
for years now and have tweaked my vimrc a lot, I had several
phases, a setup with lots of plugins and a setup with no plugins
at all. Nowadays I tend to use a minimal vimrc, which is useful
for using vim on any server, I dont miss much my personal custom
shortcuts.

But after seing a Teejay video about one particular plugin, named Oil,
I got curious to see how is the Neovim project going along this days.
Other people I follow online like the streamer Primeagen seem
to be very found of it too, maybe because of LSP integrations
(treesiter? I dont even know the project names to be frank) or maybe
because of his own plugin for navigating files (harpoon?)

Anyways, I have tried Helix last year for sometime, and I have to
confess that such a plug and play experience with LSP integrations
where a nice thing to have that I am not used to with my bare
ancient vanilla vim. And Helix also has a bigger mind adaptation
of different shortcuts (that are suppose to make more sense) and the
idea of visual mode first, so you dont have to guess beforehand
if you are applying the command to the expected part of the text.

Well, I still want to see Helix succed, but at the same time I feel
that "unlearning" some vim keybindings might be a hard task.

This log is the first one of a new personal journey to try Neovim again.

I see that there is this project "kickstart" that is meant to be a 
batteries included template config with batteries included. I have setup
that and I think it would be a good place to grab references.

But at the same time, I want to see how is the "minimalist" neovim
experience, If such a thing even exists, I want to know what is the
bare minimum config and how few plugins I can say that is really needed
for a decent experience, I am thinking about having 2 installations/configs:
one that is top-down, with the kickstarter template as-is, and one that 
is bottom up, with that starts with no configs at all and I build
incrementally from there.
